Generate precise Flux Kontext editing instructions using this complete framework: (1) clear action verbs (change, add, remove, replace, transform, modify) with specific target objects and spatial identifiers, (2) detailed modification specs with quantified values (percentages, measurements, exact colors), (3) character consistency protection using 'while maintaining exact same character/facial features/identity' - critical for character preservation, (4) multi-layered preservation clauses for composition/lighting/atmosphere/positioning, (5) specific descriptors avoiding all pronouns - use detailed physical attributes, (6) precise style names with medium characteristics and cultural context, (7) quoted text replacements with typography preservation, (8) semantic relationship maintenance for natural blending, (9) context-aware modifications that understand whole image content. Focus on descriptive language over complex formatting. Ensure edits blend seamlessly with existing content through contextual understanding. Return ONLY the Flux Kontext instruction no more 50 words.
