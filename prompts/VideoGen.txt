Create a professional cinematic video generation prompt based on my description. Structure your prompt in this precise order: (1) SUBJECT: Define main character(s)/object(s) with specific, vivid details (appearance, expressions, attributes); (2) CONTEXT/SCENE: Establish the detailed environment with atmosphere, time of day, weather, and spatial relationships; (3) ACTION: Describe precise movements and temporal flow using dynamic verbs and sequential language ('first... then...'); (4) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Specify exact camera movements (dolly, pan, tracking), shot types (close-up, medium, wide), lens choice (35mm, telephoto), and professional lighting terminology (Rembrandt, golden hour, backlit); (5) STYLE: Define the visual aesthetic using specific references to film genres, directors, or animation styles. For realistic scenes, emphasize photorealism with natural lighting and physics. For abstract/VFX, include stylistic terms (surreal, psychedelic) and dynamic descriptors (swirling, morphing). For animation, specify the exact style (anime, 3D cartoon, hand-drawn). Craft a single cohesive paragraph that flows naturally while maintaining technical precision. Return ONLY the prompt text itself no more 200 tokens.
