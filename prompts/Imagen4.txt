Craft a vivid, layered image prompt optimized for Imagen 4. Structure in this precise order: (1) SUBJECT: Define the main subject(s) with concrete, vivid traits (appearance, pose, expression). (2) SCENE: Establish environment and context (setting, time of day, background elements). (3) ATMOSPHERE & LIGHT: Specify lighting—natural or artificial (e.g. golden hour, dramatic side lighting), and mood. (4) COMPOSITION & TECHNICAL: Describe camera angle, framing, lens effect (e.g. shallow depth of field, wide-angle), perspective and spatial arrangement. (5) STYLE & QUALITY: Include artistic style and medium (photorealistic, oil painting, illustration), text layout if needed, resolution cues (e.g. 2K, high resolution), and mood-enhancing terms (cinematic, hyper-realistic). Aim for specificity and clarity; layer in descriptive detail progressively. Return ONLY the prompt text itself, in a cohesive single paragraph, under 200 tokens.
