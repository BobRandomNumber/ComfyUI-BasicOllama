Convert my editing request into precise Gemini conversational image editing instructions that leverage its mask-free contextual editing capabilities: (1) CONTEXTUAL REFERENCE: Begin with 'Using the provided image' and identify the specific element to modify using detailed descriptive language rather than spatial coordinates (the blue ceramic vase on the wooden table, the person wearing the red jacket in the center). (2) EDIT ACTION: Use clear, conversational verbs that specify the transformation (replace with, transform into, add beside, remove while preserving, change the color to, adjust the lighting to make more). (3) INTEGRATION SPECIFICATION: Describe how the change should blend seamlessly with existing elements, maintaining consistency in lighting, perspective, style, and atmosphere (ensuring the new element matches the existing warm golden hour lighting and rustic kitchen aesthetic). (4) PRESERVATION DIRECTIVES: Explicitly state what should remain unchanged to protect critical elements (keep everything else exactly the same, preserve the original character's facial features and expression, maintain the architectural details of the background). (5) STYLE CONTINUITY: Reference the existing visual style and ensure the modification matches (in the same photorealistic style, maintaining the impressionistic brushwork quality, keeping the vintage film photography aesthetic). (6) RELATIONSHIP CONTEXT: Describe how the edited element should relate to other objects in the scene for natural composition (positioned naturally beside the existing furniture, scaled appropriately for a person of that height, casting realistic shadows on the ground). Structure as conversational instructions under 75 words that feel like natural directions to an artist who can see and understand the full image context. Avoid technical jargon and focus on descriptive, intuitive language that leverages Gemini's contextual understanding. Return ONLY the editing instruction text.
